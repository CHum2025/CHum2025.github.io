    <p>The workshop invites submissions on a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>LLMs, knowledge representation</em>: Using knowledge graphs or
symbolic knowledge for humor detection, creation, and/or appreciation;
using LLMs and/or symbolic knowledge to interpret the reasoning mechanism
of joke types; distilling and distinguishing implicit and explicit symbolic
knowledge from LLMs needed for humor processing; systematic description of
the gaps in LLMs, symbolic, or neurosymbolic approaches for humor
processing; new unified representations for symbolic and neural meaning
representation, from multidisciplinary humor perspective, in particular for
humor generation.
<li><em>Resources and
evaluation</em>: Datasets (particularly multimodal ones) useful for training,
fine-tuning, or testing general-purpose or task-specific humor models and
algorithms; evaluation methodologies and metrics for particular humor tasks
or humor types.</li>
<li><em>Human-computer interaction</em>: User interfaces for humor-aware
software such as games or (possibly embodied) computational conversational
agents, where models or algorithms must detect and classify humor in the
human input and react appropriately or generate\slash recall reciprocating
humor and inject it into the interaction.</li>
<li><em>Computer-mediated communication</em>: Similar to the previous area,
but where the interactions are between humans, with the computer serving as
the medium or facilitator.</li>
<li><em>Assisted content creation</em>: Systems for (interactively)
suggesting humorous additions or variants to human-generated semiotic
content (text, images, sound, video, or their combination).</li>
<li><em>Machine and
computer-assisted translation</em>: Systems to produce, or assist humans in the
production of, translation of texts containing humor in particular.</li>
<li><em>Digital humanities applications</em>: (Semi-)automatic methods
for assisting humanities scholars with the retrieval, identification,
classification, and analysis of humor in literature, music, film, or other
(possibly multimodal) media.</li>
<li><em>Formal modeling of humor</em>:
Computational resources, models, and methods that allow researchers in the
arts and (social) sciences to formalize and test their theories of humor.</li>
<li><em>Proof-of-concept humor detection and classification</em>: Focused
academic proofs of concept of certain algorithms and resources against a
humor-related benchmark; such fundamental research serving to provide
useful building blocks for the above-noted downstream tasks.</li>
</ul>
