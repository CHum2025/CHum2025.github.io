<div class="page__content">

<p style="font-size: 150%">The <strong>1st Workshop on Computational
Humor (CHum 2025)</strong> will take place <strong>virtually on
January 19 or 20, 2025</strong> (exact date TBD) as part of
the <strong>31st International Conference on Computational Linguistics
(COLING 2025)</strong>.<p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>The impressive recent progress in generative AI has enabled new
approaches to complex tasks that can be thought of as essentially
human, such as producing or understanding humor. For its part, humor
research has become a mature, interdisciplinary field, both in
theoretical advances across disciplines such as psychology,
linguistics, and sociology, and in a breadth of purview and empirical
support. Our workshop aims to foster further work on modeling the
processes of humor with current methods in computational linguistics
and natural language processing, against the theoretical backdrop of
humor research and with reference to relevant corpora of textual,
visual, and multimodal materials.</p>

<p>Being more dependent on context and inference than straightforward
forms of communication, humor poses particular challenges for
probabilistic approaches.  In some cases, the required
background knowledge may not be available from a single modality,
such as a text, and as such may not be machine-learnable in a
straightforward manner. With this in mind, a principal goal of this
workshop is to unite researchers who can together probe the limits of
various meaning representations&mdash;symbolic, neural, and
hybrid&mdash;for humor processing.</p>

<h2>Submission information</h2>

<p>CHum 2025 welcomes contributions on any topic relevant to the
computational processing of humor.  Particularly encouraged are
submissions describing inter- or multi-disciplinary work, whether
completed or in progress, and position papers that critically discuss
the past, present, and future of computational humor systems.  Please
refer to the
<strong><a href="call-for-papers.html">call for papers</a></strong>
for further information on topics and submission instructions.</p>
