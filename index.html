        <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The impressive recent progress in generative AI has enabled new
approaches to complex tasks that can be thought of as essentially human,
such as producing or understanding humor. For its part, humor research has
become a mature, interdisciplinary field, both in theoretical advances
across disciplines such as psychology, linguistics, and sociology, and in a
breadth of purview and empirical support. Our workshop aims to foster
further work on modeling the processes of humor with current methods in
computational linguistics and natural language processing, against the
theoretical backdrop of humor research and with reference to relevant
corpora of textual, visual, and multimodal materials.</p>

<p>Being more dependent on context and inference than straightforward forms of
communication, humor poses particular challenges for probabilistic
approaches. For these and other reasons, it has long served as a special
field of application for computational linguistic&mdash;understanding humor
has often been referred to as "AI complete" (Raskin 1988)&mdash;and as
such could be considered a potential test case for Artificial General
Intelligence.</p>

<p>Computational humor (Winters 2021) is especially hard as analysis, where it
must be assumed to require extensive background knowledge to reproduce the
complex, para-logical inferences that are one of the necessary elements of
humor. Computational humor analysis with modest scope is nevertheless
attempted (e.g., Hessel 2022, Xu 2024), but often culminates in
classification tasks of unknown usefulness. Successes in computational
humor generation (e.g., Gorenz & Schwarz 2024, Jentzsch 2023), on the other
hand, are possible with limited resources, often in combination with
prompt-engineering LLMs, and can be greatly aided by post-editing or other
"co-creative" approaches (Branch 2024, Mirowski 2024). Humor generation
also succeeds because much of the humor work is on the part of the hearer,
who dutifully succeeds when a text is marked as humor, even if the text
might not have been imbued with all the necessary and sufficient components
to be humor-carrying by the computational generation system.</p>

<p>There are arguments that humor relies on background knowledge that may not
be available from a single modality, such as a text, and as such is not
machine-learnable in a straightforward manner. With this in mind, a
principal goal of this workshop is to unite researchers who can together
probe the limits of various meaning representations&mdash;symbolic, neural,
and hybrid (e.g., Toplyn 2023, Amin 2020, Zhang 2020, Dong 2024)&mdash;for
humor processing.</p>

<p>The workshop will welcome contributions on any topic relevant to
the computational processing of humor, including (but not limited to)
the following themes and application areas.  Particularly encouraged
are submissions describing inter- or multi-disciplinary work, whether
completed or in progress, and position papers that critically discuss
the past, present, and future of computational humor systems.</p>
